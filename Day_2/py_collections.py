"""Python Collections (Arrays)

There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

	List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
	
	Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
	
	Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
	
	Dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members.

When choosing a collection type, it is useful to understand the properties of that type. Choosing the right type for a particular data set could mean retention of meaning, and, it could mean an increase in efficiency or security.
