"""
Python Lamba:

A lambda function is a small anonymous function.

A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression

Syntax:

lambda arguments : expression

"""

print("Example 1: lambda")



## Lambda functions can take any number of arguments:
print("Example 1: lambda multiple arguments")



# A lambda function that sums argument a, b, and c and print the result:
print("Example 3: sum using lambda")



"""
Why Use Lambda Functions?

The power of lambda is better shown when you use them as an anonymous function inside another function.

Say you have a function definition that takes one argument, and that argument will be multiplied with an unknown number:
"""

print("Example 5: lambda with functions")
